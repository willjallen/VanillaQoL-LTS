# VanillaQoL-LTS

A "95% vanilla" QoL modpack with long-term support(LTS) for client & server.

Most mods are quality-of-life(QoL) mods such a shaders & various visual candies, distant horizons, (mini)/map, controller support, inventory sorting, xp bottling, many client and server optimizations and other minor gameplay tweaks.

The 5% not vanilla content are unintruisive noncritical items such as universal shops, nature's compass and waystones.

In general, this modpack aims to avoid minecraft version locking, allow long running, multi-year worlds with a low barrier to upgrade to new minecraft versions without breaking too much.

We aim to meet the following criteria:

Mods with proven track record of long-term support.
Adheres to the spirit of a Vanilla game.
Stable between Minecraft versions.
All modded items/blocks/mechanics are tangential, non critical, and if they disappear from version to version it will not break the world, players builds aesthetically or functionally in an overly disruptive way.

Notes:

Tectonic world generation is enabled by default for synergy with Distant Horizons. The mod appears well supported, but would break existing worlds if it becomes unsupported in the future. If true LTS is desired it's recommended to disable this.
